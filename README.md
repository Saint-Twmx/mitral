# Mitral analyze

We first trained a segmentation model based on the Unet for cardiac structures, especially the mitral valve structure of the left heart, and you can refer to https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/MedNeXt for the training and inference code. Then, we used the segmentation results for further measurement using measurement algorithms, including but not limited to CC, TT, AP, mitral annular plane, mitral annular circumference/area, non-planar angles, angles between the mitral annulus and the aorta, left atrial analysis, and papillary muscle analysis, etc.

# Model Training
We utilized the MedNeXt framework and tested the results under S3, S5, B3, B5, and M3 models respectively. Here, we provide the results obtained from training on a partial dataset using the S3 model, which achieved relatively high DICE scores.

The DICE values for both the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets exceed 0.85.

# Segmentation Capabilities
Our network successfully segments a wide range of cardiac structures, including but not limited to:
- Aorta
- Aortic valve
- Right atrium
- Left ventricle
- Left ventricular myocardium
- Papillary muscles
- Left atrium
- Anterior mitral valve leaflet
- Posterior mitral valve leaflet
- Left and right coronary arteries
- Left circumflex artery
- Coronary sinus
- Calcifications

# Release
We have made public the following components:

1.Measurement and Calculation Framework: A comprehensive codebase for various cardiac measurements.

2.Diverse Measurement Algorithms: Implementations for calculating a wide range of metrics, including but not limited to:
- Annulus dimensions
- Anteroposterior (AP) diameter
- Commissure-to-commissure (CC) diameter
- Tenting height (TH)
- Leaflet lengths
- Left atrial analysis
- Papillary muscle analysis

This will automatically install all required dependencies.

# Running the Project
1.Place your test data in the input folder within the project directory.
2.Run the main script:
```
python run.py
```
3.The script will automatically:
- Read test data from the input folder
- Perform segmentation
- Conduct measurements
- Save results back to the input folder

# Output
After running the script, you can find the following in the input folder:
- Segmentation results
- Measurement data
- Any other output generated by the pipeline
